## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## Wireframes

Include links to the images of your wireframes.

## Priority Matrix

Include a link to your full the `Time\Priority` Matix.  

## MVP

Include a bulleted list of the features that will be part of your MVP

* Use react native maps to render a map on the screen
* Create a backend that includes a database of all bathrooms
* Render all bathroom locations as both markers on the map
* also have a list component so the user can switch between map view or list view

## POST MVP

Include a bulleted list of the features that will be part of POST MVP

* Make app compatible for laptop as well- not sure how
* Contact form for user to submit suggestions
* launch to app store


## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusablility.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Render Map | H | 10hrs| 8hrs | 8hrs |
| Create Bathrooms DB | H | 12hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |
| Render Markers | H | 5hrs| 2hrs | 2hrs |
| Render responsive List View | H | 10hrs| 0hrs | 0hrs |

## Helper Functions
Helper functions should be generic enought that they can be reused in other applications. Use this section to document all helper functions that fall into this category.

| Function | Description |
| --- | :---: |  
| Capitalize | This will capitalize the first letter in a string |

## Additional Libraries
 Use this section to list all supporting libraries and their role in the project.
 * react-native-maps
 * react-native

## Code Snippet

Use this section to include a brief code snippet of functionality that you are proud of an a brief description.  

## Change Log
 Use this section to document what changes were made and the reasoning behind those changes.  

## Issues and Resolutions
 Use this section to list of all major issues encountered and their resolution.

 * spent hours trying to import maps form google maps, after hours, finally realized I could import from expo, and have the map be the apple map, not google maps
 * running on expo instead of running on xcode.  I found expo to be much more straight forward and less confusing

#### SAMPLE.....
**ERROR**: app.js:34 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier                                
**RESOLUTION**: Missing comma after first object in sources {} object
